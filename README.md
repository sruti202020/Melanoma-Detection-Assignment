<b>General Information</b>
<br/>Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
<br/><br/>The current analysis is based on the "Skin cancer ISIC The International Skin Imaging Collaboration" dataset

<b>Conclusions</b>
<br/>We managed to eliminate overfitting and managed to reach a decent accuracy by using:
<br/>Data augmentation
<br/>Managing Class imbalance
<br/>Using Dropout Layers

<b>Technologies Used</b>
<br/>Keras
<br/>TensorFlow
<br/>Python 3
<br/>Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib,
<br/>Augmentor
